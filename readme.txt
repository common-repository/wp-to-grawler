A one-click way to share your geolocalized content into a mobile app using the Grawler API.

== Description ==

WP to Grawler is a one-click way to share your geolocalized content into a mobile app using the Grawler API.

Using this plugin, any website or blog can upload their geolocalized content to the Grawler platform, in order to provide their community with a mobile and local service without having to develop their own mobile app.

How it works:

1) Import content from your site into Grawler in two clicks... and, that's it!

2) Your users can now look for #yourtag or @yoursite and find out your nearest contents

3) You give a mobile feature to your users, and get new ones through it!

== Installation ==
1. Upload `wp-to-grawler` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Create an account on [grawler.com](http://www.grawler.com/ "Grawler") (itâ€™s free !)
4. Activate the APi key using the plugin in any post of your wp admin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why can I use activation trough email / password or API Key? =

We provide the email / password method in order to have a very easy way to setup the Grawler API,
but we provide a dedicated API key for those who doesn't want to share their credentials.

No! The email/password method simply get your API key for you. Only this one is reccorded, and can be revocated by generating a new one
